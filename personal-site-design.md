What is your site's primary purpose?
The purpose of my sight is to document my weekly blogs about assignments, progress, learnings and journey through the 18 week Dev Academy course.


Who is your target audience?
My teachers, peers and wider audience who have an interest on my progress and whom would like to see a personal inside look at some of the things taught in the curriculum.


How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want them to feel like my site is a personal blog, so some aesthetics I want to come across is the visuals of what a diary looks and feels like. They should be able to navigate between blog entries easily and focused on the content.


How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
- easy navigation buttons
- blogs follow some form of chronological flow, to simulate a journey
- clear headings, appropraite font sizes and colours
- focus on content, and simple aesthetics, do not rely on images
